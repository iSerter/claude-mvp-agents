# Product Vision & Strategy

## Purpose

Use this Skill to turn insights about users and the market into:
- A clear product vision
- A differentiated value proposition
- Strategic pillars
- A high-level roadmap for the first 6–24 months

## Inputs

The main agent should provide:
- Key user problems & JTBD (from discovery)
- Market & competitor insights
- Business goals (e.g., revenue targets, strategic outcomes)
- Constraints (e.g., team size, timeline, platform)

If these are missing, infer pragmatic assumptions and label them clearly.

## Process

1. **Anchor on the problem**
   - Summarize the key problems and JTBD you are focusing on.
   - Clarify which segments you are prioritizing for v1.

2. **Define the product vision**
   - Write a concise vision statement (1–3 sentences) that describes:
     - Who it’s for
     - What change it creates
     - Why it matters
   - Optionally, add an "elevator pitch" narrative.

3. **Value proposition**
   - Articulate 3–5 value propositions:
     - For each, specify:
       - Target segment
       - Key outcome
       - How this product delivers it better than alternatives

4. **Strategic pillars**
   - Define 3–5 strategic pillars (e.g., "Automation over manual work", "Integrate with existing tools", "Trust & transparency").
   - For each pillar:
     - Describe what it means
     - Example features or decisions it drives
     - What you will **not** prioritize because of it

5. **High-level roadmap**
   - Propose a roadmap broken into phases (e.g., v0.1 experiment, v1 launch, v2 expansion).
   - For each phase:
     - Objectives
     - Key bets or themes
     - Rough time horizon (e.g., quarter-based)
   - Emphasize learning milestones and de-risking, not just feature volume.

6. **Success metrics**
   - Suggest a small set of metrics tied to:
     - User value (e.g., activation, retention, task completion)
     - Business value (e.g., revenue, expansion, cost savings)
   - Include leading indicators where possible.

7. **Outputs**

Produce markdown with:
- Problem & context summary
- Vision statement & elevator pitch
- Value propositions
- Strategic pillars (with "we will" / "we will not" examples)
- Roadmap phases
- Suggested success metrics

## Example

Given insights about small teams struggling with analytics setup, you might propose:
- Vision: "Give every small team a plug-and-play analytics brain that answers questions in plain language."
- Pillars: "no dashboards", "self-service for non-analysts", "privacy by default".
- Roadmap: Start with one data source + narrow use case, then expand.
