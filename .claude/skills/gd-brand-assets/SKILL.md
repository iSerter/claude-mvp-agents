# Brand & Graphic Assets Planning

## Purpose

Use this Skill to define the set of **graphic assets** a startup or business is likely to need, and provide brief-style specifications for each.

## Inputs

The main agent should provide:
- Company or product description
- Target audience and primary channels (e.g., web, mobile, social, email)
- Stage of company (early-stage startup vs established)

## Process

1. **Asset inventory**
   - List common asset types, such as:
     - App icons
     - Social profile images and cover banners
     - Website hero illustrations
     - Empty state illustrations
     - Onboarding graphics
     - Presentation templates
     - Email headers

2. **Prioritization**
   - Identify which assets are **must-have** vs **nice-to-have** given the company’s stage and channels.

3. **Brief per asset type**
   For each prioritized asset type:
   - Specify:
     - Purpose and where it will be used
     - Style direction (aligned with logo and brand personality)
     - Content hints (e.g., metaphors, scenes, abstraction vs literal)
     - Format and size expectations (conceptual, not pixel-perfect unless known)

4. **Consistency guidance**
   - Add guidelines to ensure all assets:
     - Share a cohesive visual language
     - Reuse elements and colors from the logo/brand

## Output

Produce a markdown **Brand Assets Plan** with:
- Asset inventory and priorities
- Detailed briefs for each must-have asset
- Consistency and evolution notes
