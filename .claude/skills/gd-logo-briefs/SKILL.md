# Logo Design Briefs

## Purpose

Use this Skill to create **logo design briefs** that can be handed to a visual designer or design tool.

## Inputs

The main agent should provide:
- Company or product name
- Description of what the company does
- Target audience and positioning
- Any known brand attributes or constraints

If missing, infer reasonable assumptions and call them out.

## Process

1. **Brand summary**
   - Summarize:
     - What the company does
     - Who it serves
     - Desired brand personality (e.g., friendly, professional, experimental)

2. **Logo requirements**
   - Clarify:
     - Logo type preferences (wordmark, symbol, combination, lettermark, etc.)
     - Usage contexts (web app, mobile app, print, social avatars)
     - Practical constraints (legibility at small sizes, dark/light backgrounds)

3. **Creative directions**
   - Propose 3–5 distinct creative directions.
   - For each direction, specify:
     - Concept/story
     - Style (minimalist, geometric, organic, playful, etc.)
     - Shape & form hints
     - Initial color directions (high-level, not exact hex if unknown)
     - Example applications (e.g., app icon, navbar, favicon)

4. **File & format expectations**
   - Outline expectations such as:
     - Vector format
     - Monochrome version
     - Horizontal vs stacked variants

5. **Evaluation criteria**
   - Suggest criteria to judge logo concepts against.

## Output

Produce a markdown **Logo Design Brief** with:
- Brand summary
- Requirements
- 3–5 creative directions (clearly separated)
- Technical expectations
- Evaluation criteria
