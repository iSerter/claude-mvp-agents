# Market & Competitor Research

## Purpose

Use this Skill when the goal is to understand:
- Who the main competitors and alternatives are
- How they position themselves and what they offer
- Where there are gaps or opportunities for differentiation

This should focus on **practical product implications**, not just a generic market summary.

## Inputs

The main agent should provide:
- Product idea / problem space
- Target market or segment (if known)
- Any known competitors or reference products

## Process

1. **Clarify the scope**
   - Restate the problem space and target market.
   - Identify what kind of competition matters most:
     - Direct competitors
     - Indirect competitors / substitutes
     - DIY / “do nothing” as a baseline

2. **Competitor overview**
   - List 5–10 relevant competitors or alternatives.
   - For each, capture:
     - Target segment
     - Core value proposition
     - Key features / capabilities
     - Pricing approach (high-level)
     - Notable strengths & weaknesses

3. **Feature & positioning comparison**
   - Create a simple comparison table for top 3–5 competitors vs the proposed product direction:
     - Rows: capabilities / dimensions that matter to users
     - Columns: competitors + "our proposed product"
   - Highlight where the market is crowded vs underserved.

4. **Market gaps & opportunities**
   - Identify:
     - Underserved segments
     - Jobs or workflows with poor coverage
     - Over-served / over-complex solutions (opportunity for simplicity)
   - Propose 3–7 concrete differentiation angles.

5. **Risks & barriers**
   - List risks such as:
     - Strong incumbents
     - Switching costs
     - Regulatory or integration challenges
   - Suggest mitigation ideas or validation steps.

6. **Outputs**

Produce a markdown summary with:
- Brief market overview
- Competitor list
- Comparison table
- Market gaps & differentiation options
- Risks & open questions
- Implications for product strategy

## Examples

When asked:

> "We want to build an AI documentation assistant for engineers."

You should:
- Identify existing tools (e.g., doc tools, AI assistants).
- Compare how they serve engineers today.
- Highlight where workflows are still painful (e.g., keeping docs updated, onboarding, API examples).
- Suggest specific positioning, such as "always up-to-date architecture companion" or "PR-driven documentation generator."
