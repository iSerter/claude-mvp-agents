# Ad Banner Design Briefs

## Purpose

Use this Skill to specify ad banner designs for performance or brand campaigns in formats such as:
- Square (e.g., 1080x1080)
- Leaderboard (e.g., 728x90)
- Rectangle (e.g., 300x250)

## Inputs

The main agent should provide:
- Product or offer being advertised
- Target audience
- Campaign goal (awareness, signup, trial, etc.)
- Brand tone (if available)

## Process

1. **Campaign summary**
   - Clarify the core message and target action (e.g., "Start free trial", "Book a demo").

2. **Per-format briefs**
   For each format (square, leaderboard, rectangle):
   - Define:
     - Primary message (headline)
     - Supporting text (subcopy)
     - Call-to-action text
     - Suggested layout (e.g., logo placement, imagery vs text balance)
     - Visual style hints (simple vs detailed, photography vs illustration)

3. **Copy & hierarchy**
   - Ensure:
     - Short, scannable copy suitable for banners.
     - Clear visual hierarchy (what the eye sees first, second, third).

4. **Technical & platform considerations**
   - Note:
     - Need for variants (A/B tests on headlines or imagery)
     - File formats and size constraints (conceptual level)
     - Animation vs static expectations (if relevant)

## Output

Produce a markdown **Ad Banner Design Brief** with:
- Campaign overview
- Separate sections for each banner format
- Key messages and layout guidance
- Notes on variations and testing
