# Design Brief Creation

## Purpose

Use this Skill to transform a PRD or high-level product idea into a **design brief** that gives clear direction for UI/UX work.

## Inputs

The main agent should provide:
- PRD or product description (including goals and target users)
- Any constraints (platform, brand, timeline, technical)
- Business objectives (e.g., activation, retention, conversion)

If any of these are missing, infer pragmatic assumptions and label them clearly.

## Process

1. **Context summary**
   - Summarize:
     - Product / feature being designed
     - Primary user segments
     - Business goals for this design work

2. **Objectives & success criteria**
   - Define:
     - UX objectives (e.g., reduce time-to-completion, improve clarity)
     - Business success criteria (e.g., increase signups by X%)

3. **User & usage context**
   - Describe:
     - Who is using the product
     - In what situation (environment, device, time pressure)
     - Key motivations and pain points relevant to this design

4. **Functional scope**
   - List the core user tasks this design must support.
   - Call out what is explicitly **out of scope** for this iteration.

5. **Constraints & requirements**
   - Platform constraints (web, mobile, responsive, etc.)
   - Brand / visual constraints (existing identity, design system)
   - Technical and data constraints (performance, integrations, permissions)

6. **Risks & open questions**
   - Identify unknowns that could impact UX.
   - Propose research or validation steps.

7. **Deliverables**
   - Clarify downstream deliverables (IA, flows, wireframes, hi-fi plan).

## Output

Produce a concise markdown **Design Brief** with sections:
- Overview & context
- Objectives & success criteria
- Users & context of use
- Core user tasks
- Scope (in / out)
- Constraints
- Risks & open questions
- Next design steps
